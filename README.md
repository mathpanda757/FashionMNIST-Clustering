# üñºÔ∏è FashionMNIST-Clustering - Discover Patterns in Fashion Data

[![Download Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Latest%20Release-v1.0-blue)](https://github.com/mathpanda757/FashionMNIST-Clustering/releases)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Welcome to the FashionMNIST-Clustering project! This application helps you analyze fashion images by grouping them into clusters. You will be able to see how well different styles of clothing relate to each other through visualizations. You do not need any programming skills to use this software. 

## üì• Download & Install

To get started, visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/mathpanda757/FashionMNIST-Clustering/releases) to download the software. Simply click on the latest version and follow the instructions.

## üìÇ System Requirements

Before you install, make sure your computer meets these requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or higher, macOS 10.12 or higher, or a recent Linux distribution.
- **RAM:** At least 4GB of RAM.
- **Disk Space:** 500MB of free space for installation and data processing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Application

After downloading the software, follow these steps to run it:

1. Locate the downloaded file (usually in your Downloads folder).
2. Double-click the file to start the installation process.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
4. Once installed, find the application icon and double-click to open it.

## üí° Features

The FashionMNIST-Clustering application offers several features to help you explore and understand fashion data:

- **Image Analysis:** Analyze 5,000 fashion images to reveal unique clusters.
- **Clustering Methods:** Utilize K-Means and Agglomerative clustering techniques to group similar items.
- **Visualizations:** View detailed visual representations of clusters for better understanding.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate your clusters using Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and V-measure metrics.

## üìä Using the Application

Once you have the application running, you can explore the following steps:

1. **Load Data:** Start by loading the Fashion-MNIST dataset. This dataset contains grayscale images of clothing items such as shirts, shoes, and bags.
2. **Choose Clustering Method:** Select either K-Means or Agglomerative clustering to analyze the data.
3. **Run Analysis:** Click the "Analyze" button to begin the clustering process. This may take a few moments depending on your computer's performance.
4. **View Results:** After the analysis, you will see clusters displayed visually. You can explore each group to understand patterns.

## üîç Understanding the Clusters

You can use the visualizations provided to identify trends in how clothing items relate to one another. For instance, you might see a cluster for sporty items or another for formal wear. This insight can help you better understand fashion preferences and styles.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using the application, consider these solutions:

- **Installation Failed:** Ensure you have enough disk space and that your operating system is supported.
- **Application Crashes:** Make sure your system meets the requirements and try closing other applications to free up resources.
- **Data Not Loading:** Check your internet connection and ensure that the dataset is compatible with the application.
